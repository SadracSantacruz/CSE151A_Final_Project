We observed that the file extensions across images are inconsistent, with some using uppercase letters (e.g., "JPG" instead of "jpg") 
and others varying in format (png, jpeg, jpg), so we need to standardize all file extensions to lowercase for uniformity. Additionally, 
image sizes are inconsistent, requiring resizing in a later preprocessing step to ensure uniform dimensions. The dataset consists of 400 images divided into four classes: Bus, Car, Motorcycle, and Truck. 
The number of unique image dimensions per class is as follows: Bus – 82, Car – 71, Motorcycle – 74, and Truck – 78.
